Currently it is a need for the African Diaspora to have Reparations for the harsh treatment by other cultures; and for the African Diaspora to have comerse in the diaspora for their own economic development.
    21 billion Diaspora coins will be minted. Eleven billion will go to the Decentralized Automomouse Organization (DAO) and those who support the initial development.
    Five billion are set aside for membership rewards. Five billion are for public domain. The goal is for the coin to be worth greater than or equal to $1.50 usd per Diaspora Coin.
    800 thousand Reparations coins will be worth 1 Diaspora coin. A DAO and DEX will be built to be the native platform for the coins. We will start with a Solidity Smart Contract on the Binnance Smartchain. Therefore, as the finances come in, and our DEX is built we will migrate to our own Blockchain. Initially we want the Diaspora and Reparations coin to be paired with the Binance BNB coin. A liquidity pool will be set up to pairing BNB with Diaspora Coin. One Diaspora Coin = 0.06788 BNB. Those individuals, organizations and governments wishing to pay reparations to the African Diaspora can provide liquidity by joining our liquidity pool. Reparations will be dispersed by the philanthropy of the DAO to individuals and businesses in the Diaspora.
